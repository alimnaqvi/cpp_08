# C++ Module 08: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

This project is part of the curriculum at 42 school.

Core concepts learned and applied:
- Exercise 00: Easy find
  - Standard template library / container classes
  - Common member functions of STL such as push_back(), pop_back(), size(), capacity(), etc.
  - Iterators
  - Container traversal
  - Range-based for loops
  - Usage of begin(), end(), std:next(), std::prev(), std::distance(), etc.
  - Constant iterators
  - Standard library algorithms
- Exercise 01: Span
  -
